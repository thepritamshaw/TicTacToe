# Command Line Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a command line version of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, but with a twist - it is N x N, where N is a number defined in the code.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the files are located.
3. Compile the source code using the following command: 
```bash
gcc -o tictactoe tictactoe.c
```
4. Run the executable using the following command:
```bash
./tictactoe
```
5. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen to enter the positions where you want to place your marker.
6. The first player to get N markers in a row, column, or diagonal wins!
7. If no player can get N markers in a row, column, or diagonal, the game is a draw.

Have fun playing!
